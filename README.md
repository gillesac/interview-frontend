# Front-end Developer Test Project

## Project brief

Once started, you have 2 days to convert two pages in the `design` folder to HTML/CSS/JS. They are part of a full
website and contain links to other pages that are not included in the PSD files.
Please do not worry about those links. You just need to focus on the layout,
styles and interactive components on two pages only. Once you have completed the task, please commit and push to a new branch named with your first and last name.

### Interactive components

- On the home page, a drop-up menu should be displayed when the mouse hovers over
the up arrows.
- On the about us page, you need to implement the tab switching in the left hand side menu.
Please refer to the PSD file for the tab contents.

## Requirements

1. Generate the project using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/);
2. Install the dependencies using [Bower](http://bower.io/);
3. Run the website using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/);
4. Use HTML5/CSS3;
5. Ensure that the website supports modern browsers (IE9+).

**Bonus** Can you make the website work on mobile devices. You may need to think about
the mobile website design in terms of usability and adjust the interactive
components accordingly.

## Coding standards

We prefer the following coding standards:

- HTML & CSS: [Code Guide by @mdo](http://codeguide.co/);
- JavaScript: [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml).

Also, we value [semantic markup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML).

## Project delivery

You need to clone this repository, do the tasks in a new branch, and push it
once it's done.

Your commit log will be checked, so please breakdown the changes into multiple
commits and write [effective commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

## Tools

If you don't have Adobe Photoshop installed, we recommend using the following
free applications to view and edit a PSD file:

- [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/) + [PSD Plugin](http://psdplugin.codeplex.com/)
(Windows);
- [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) (Mac, *nix).
